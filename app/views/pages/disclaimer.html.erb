		Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations, some
		of which are described below. no representation is being made that any
		account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to

			One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that
			they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight. In
			addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk, and no
			hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of
			financial risk in actual trading. Example; The ability to
			withstand losses or adhere to a particular trading program in spite of
			trading losses are material points which can also adversely affect
			actual trading results. There are numerous other factors related to
			the markets in general or to the implementation of any specific
			trading program which cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation
			of hypothetical performance results and all of which can adversely
			affect actual trading results.
